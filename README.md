System/161 is a machine simulator that provides a simplified but still realistic environment for OS hacking. 
It is a 32-bit MIPS system supporting up to 32 processors, with up to 31 hardware slots each holding a single simple device 
(disk, console, network, etc.) It was designed to support OS/161, with a balance of simplicity and realism chosen to make it 
maximally useful for teaching. However, it also has proven useful as a platform for rapid development of research kernel 
projects.
